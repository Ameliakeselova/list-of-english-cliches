Teflon President
Tell a porkie
Tell it to me straight
Tell It to the marines
Tell your story walking
tempest in a teacup
Tend the garden
ten foot pole
Ten to one
testing one's mettle
Test the waters
thank God it's Friday
Thank goodness
Thank your lucky stars
that'll be the day
that's about the size of it
That's a doozy
That's a joke
That's all, folks
That's a load off my mind
that's a real stem-winder
that's a wrap
That's bogus
that's easy for you to say
that's enough to piss off the Pope
That's for the birds
That's how the cow eats the cabbage
that's icing on the cake
that's it in a nutshell
that's just like the pot calling the kettle black
That's just peachy
that's just the tip of the iceberg
that's like a turtle on a fence post
That's no joke
that's old hat
That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.
that's par for the course
that's pretty run-of-the-mill
that's rubber on the side of the road
that's skull duggery
that's some ole good
that's the $64,000 question
that's the long and short of it
That's the ticket
that's the way lady luck dances
that's the way the ball bounces
that's the way the cookie crumbles
that's the whole ball of wax
that's water under the bridge
That and a quarter will get you a cup of coffee
that argument doesn't hold water
that baby runs like a scalded dog
that burns me up
that chaps my hide
That dog won't hunt
that gets my goat
that hits the spot
that oughta tide you over
that really brings it home
That sucks!
That takes the cake
that was cold-blooded
That which does not kill you makes you stronger.
them's fightin' words
There'll be hell to pay
there's a first time for everything
there's a God and I'm not him
There's An R in the month
There's a sucker born every minute,
There's gold in them thar hills
there's more than one way to skin a cat
there's more where that came from
there's no place like home
there's no such thing as a free lunch
There's no time like the present,
there's one in every crowd,
there's something fishy about that
there's something I've been meaning to tell you
There, but for the grace of God, go I,
there are starving children in Africa
There are three kinds of lies.
there for the taking
There is a god
There is more than one way to skin a cat
There is no alternative
There is no cow on the ice
There is no I in team
There is no such thing as a free lunch
There is no time like the present
There now, that wasn't so bad, was it?
there ought to be a law against that
these things happen
they're getting hitched
they're jumping the broomstick
they're like two peas in a pod
They can't buy a basket/run/score
they gave him carte blanche
They need to take care of the rock,
They play good D
they threw the book at him
Thick and Thin
Thick as a brick
Thick as a ditch
Thick as pea soup
thick as thieves
Thick headed
thin as six o'clock
some things are better left unsaid
Things aren't what they used to be
things are not always as they seem
Things that go bump in the night
Thinking with the wrong head
Think like a man, act like a woman
think outside of the box
Think outside the box
The Third Degree
Third time's a charm
third time's the charm
Third Time Lucky
Third wheel
Thirty thousand (30,000) foot level
this could be the start of something big
this day and age
this hurts me worse than it does you
this is for the birds
this point in time
this town's not big enough for the two of us
Thorn in my side
a thorn in the flesh
Those who do not look back from where they come from, will not reach their destination
Though this be madness, yet there is method in it.
Thou Shalt Not Kill
Three-score years and ten

Three Strikes and you are out

Threw it with a little something on it
